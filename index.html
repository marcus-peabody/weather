The weather touches everything from the urgent issues of climate change, to the ubiquitous mundanities of everyday life. It is a minor inconvenience, a topic of small talk, or a geopolitical crisis. It is global but still entirely personal.<br><br>Unsurprisingly it infuses art and design.<br><br>Rococo painters like grand cumulonimbus clouds behind the grand subjects of their <a href ="https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/musical-group-44161/" target="_blank">grand paintings</a>. Cirrocumulus, altocumulus and stratocumulus suit the <a href ="https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/seine-giverny-44541/" target="_blank">brush strokes</a> of the impressionists. The clothes we wear play (at least some) practical role in keeping off the rain, or <a href ="https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/snow-suit-62103011/" target="_blank">keeping in the heat</a>. The environment creeps into artists’ and designers’ minds, and yields grey smoggy lithographs of the <a href ="https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/nocturne-thames-battersea-1992001137/" target="_blank">Thames</a>, and bright <a href ="https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/mans-wearing-blanket-31183/" target="_blank">textiles</a> from the American Southwest.<br><br>The result is that in museums — where art is often curated by era and region — every work in a gallery often depicts, or is the product of the same weather. This website draws from the collection at the RISD Museum to make the same connections, but across the collection.<br><br><br>
